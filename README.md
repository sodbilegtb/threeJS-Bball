# Basketball Court with three.js
This project creates a virtual basketball court using the three.js library. It includes a textured basketball, a court floor, wall, a backboard, and a hoop with a rim. The basketball animates with basic physics, demonstrating gravity and collision with the ground.

I wanted to use npm three.js first, but it didn't work well, so I changed three.js from npm to CDN usage.

## Features
- **Basketball:** A textured basketball sphere that moves and rotates.
- **Court Floor:** A textured plane representing the basketball court floor.
- **Wall:** Textured wall surrounding the court area.
- **Backboard:** Two backboards positioned at each end of the court.
- **Hoop:** Two hoops with a torus rim geometry.

## Controls
- **Mouse**: Control the camera view by clicking and dragging.
## Files Structure
- **index.html:** Main HTML file that loads the scene and dependencies.
- **src/main.js:** JavaScript file where the three.js scene is configured and animations are defined.
- **images/:** Directory containing textures used for the basketball, court, walls, and backboards.
- **styles/main.css:** CSS file for basic styling of the HTML.
